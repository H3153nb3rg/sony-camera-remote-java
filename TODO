- Add configurable serial shooting in the android app (count of shoots, interval, ???).
- Add some tests.
- Wrong regex for finding wi-fi interface (not applicable for MacOS X). Possibly need to remove it
  at all and don't bind socket to a specific interface. (See git stash)
  In this case wee will need some kind of handling for multiple SSDP-compliant devices in one network.
- Skip frames if do not have time to decode them all.
- Requests/responses for the rest RpcMethod constants.
- All necessary controls in the android app.
- Add support for the lower minimal Android version in the app.
